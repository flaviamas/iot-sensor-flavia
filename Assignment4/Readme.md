# Assignment 4
In this assignment we are going to read Accelerometer sensors data and then we will find if a person is walking or standing still. 
WE are going to use two different architectures to compute this information, the first one is an edge-based architecure and the second one is a cloud-based architecture. 
## Download 
If you want to try this code, create a new file called connectionstr.js and add your connection string to the IoT device. Then export the module and  now you can connect to the Azure Hub. Download the repository and start the server with 
`node server.js` then connect to `localhost:3000`. I suggest you to deploy the web app on Azure to use the HTTPS protocol because generic sensors work only with this protocol.
