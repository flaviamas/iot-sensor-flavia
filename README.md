# Sending IoT sensor data to Azure Hub 
My name is Flavia Masoni and this project is developed for the Internet of Things course in the MSc Degree in Engineering in computer science at Sapienza University. 
## The Idea 
Starting from simulated data we send those data to the Azure IoT Hub and then show them on a web application. 
For each assignment we modify the way we send Data to the Hub.
Below you will find all the instruction to set up each part of this project starting from the first homework.
